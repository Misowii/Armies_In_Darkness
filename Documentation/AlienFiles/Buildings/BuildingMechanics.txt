Tech Tree Philosophy:
	Buildings can serve the follow purposes:
		1. Store/collect resources
		2. Produce Units
		3. Get permenant upgrades for units
		4. Get one time upgrades for units
		5. Give passive boosts to units
	It would probably be best no building served more than one function from 2, 3, and 5.
	This logical seperation would offer distinctive building choices.
